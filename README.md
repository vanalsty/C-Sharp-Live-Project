# C-Sharp-Live-Project
#### For two weeks at The Tech Academy I worked with my peers in a team on a large-scale ASP.NET MVC web application. The application is a website for a theatre company, where their data can be managed, tickets purchased, productions viewed, archives searched, and administrator views for CRUD functionality. Working on a legacy codebase was a great learning oppertunity for fixing bugs, cleaning up code, and adding requested features. I saw how a good developer works with what they have to make a quality product. Everyone on the team had a chance to work on front end and back end stories. Over the two week sprint I utilized my skills in version control and project management using Azure DevOps.  Below are descriptions of the stories I worked on.

### What I learned
It was an invaluable experience being able to work with a nearly completed pre existing codebase and keeping the team coding practices and styles in mind when working on my stories. Working with ASP .Net MVC, Entity Framework, Razor Syntax, and Bootstrap all gave me valuable skills for the future in not only with utilizing these tools but how to better educate myself on and research for future tools as well.  I also was able to learn a lot working with a team in an agile setting.  During the two weeks we did 20-30 minute daily standups, and a weekly retrospective. It was very helpful being able to hear what everyone else was working on, interesting things they had found, roadblocks they were coming accross, their best practices, and discussing ways we could all improve in the next week.  Overall this was a great learning experience.

### **My first story** 
This was simple in order to familiarize myself with the project and get my feet wet.  I had to add a link to the Admin Dropdown to the Manage Subscribers Page.

## **My second story** 
This was front-end where I added some styling to a page where the text was undreadable. 

Here is the code.

Here is what it looked like before. Much of the text is unreadable due to the background.

Here is after styling is added.

## **My third story** 
I was tasked with reorganizing fields on a page and making some field read-only in certain situations.  

Here is the code for that. ![](/partcreate1.jpg)  ![](/partcreate2.jpg) 

Here's what it looked like.  We wanted the Character field to be able to be typed in if "Actor" is selected in the Type field.

If anything other than actor was selected, then the Character field would autopopulate with the Person's name and be read-only.

## **My fourth story** 
This was my last story of the two week sprint was to seed the database with 5 seasons of the theatre company's shows.  The data included show dates and times, pictures, and information about the productions.  

Here's a sample of some of that code.

Here's what it looked like on the website.
