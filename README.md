# C-Sharp-Live-Project
For two weeks at The Tech Academy I worked with my peers in a team on a large-scale ASP.NET MVC web application. The application is a website for a theatre company, where their data can be managed, tickets purchased, productions viewed, archives searched, and administrator views for CRUD functionality. Working on a legacy codebase was a great learning oppertunity for fixing bugs, cleaning up code, and adding requested features. I saw how a good developer works with what they have to make a quality product. Everyone on the team had a chance to work on front end and back end stories. Over the two week sprint I utilized my skills in version control and project management using Azure DevOps.  Below are descriptions of the stories I worked on.

### **My first story** 
This was simple in order to familiarize myself with the project and get my feet wet.  I had to add a link to the Admin Dropdown to the Manage Subscribers Page.

## **My second story** 
This was front-end where I added some styling to a page where the text was undreadable.  Here is the code. ![](/createsubscriberstyling4.jpg) ![](/createsubscriberstyling5.jpg)  Here is what it looked like before. Much of the text is unreadable due to the background. ![](/createsubscriberstyling2.jpg)  Here is after styling is added. ![](/createsubscriberstyling3.jpg)

## **My third story** 
I was tasked with reorganizing fields on a page and making some field read-only in certain situations.  Here is the code for that. ![](/partcreate1.jpg)  ![](/partcreate2.jpg) Here's what it looked like.  We wanted the Character field to be able to be typed in if "Actor" is selected in the Type field. ![](/partcreate4.jpg) If anything other than actor was selected, then the Character field would autopopulate with the Person's name. ![](/partcreate5.jpg)

## **My fourth story** 
This was my last story of the two week sprint was to seed the database with 5 seasons of the theatre company's shows.  The data included show dates and times, pictures, and information about the productions.  Here's a sample of some of that code. ![](/seedseasons3.jpg)  ![](/seedseasons4.jpg) ![](/seedseasons5.jpg) ![](/seedseasons8.jpg) Here's what it looked like on the website.
