# C-Sharp-Live-Project
For two weeks at The Tech Academy I worked with my peers in a team on a large-scale ASP.NET MVC web application. The application is a website for a theatre company, where their data can be managed, tickets purchased, productions viewed, archives searched, and administrator views for CRUD functionality. Working on a legacy codebase was a great learning oppertunity for fixing bugs, cleaning up code, and adding requested features. I saw how a good developer works with what they have to make a quality product. Everyone on the team had a chance to work on front end and back end stories. Over the two week sprint I utilized my skills in version control and project management using Azure DevOps.  Below are descriptions of the stories I worked on.

My first story was simple in order to familiarize myself with the project and get my feet wet.  I had to add a link to the Admin Dropdown to the Subcriber Index Page.  You can find my code here and the display here.

My second story was front-end where I added some styling to a page where the text was undreadable.  You can find the code here and the before and after here.

My third story I was tasked with reorganizing fields on a page and making some field read-only in certain situations.  Here is the code for that.  Here's what it looked like.

My fourth and final story of the two week sprint was to seed the database with 5 seasons of the theatre company's shows.  The data included show dates and times, pictures, and information about the productions.  Here's a sample of some of that code.  Here's what it looked like on the website.
